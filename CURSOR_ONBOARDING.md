## 1. Living Document Rules & Policies

### Document Preservation Policy
- **NEVER remove or overwrite existing content** â€“ This is a living document that accumulates knowledge.
- **ALWAYS append new information** to relevant sections or create new sections with timestamps.
- **Preserve all historical context** â€“ Previous decisions, debugging steps, and solutions are valuable.
- **Use chronological timestamps** for all new additions (e.g., "ðŸ†• June 2025: New Feature").
- **Cross-reference related sections** when adding new information.

### Testing Requirements & Output Capture System
- **ALL tests must implement text file output capture** for debugging and analysis.
- **Create timestamped output files** (e.g., `test_results_20250625_143022.txt`).
- **Implement automatic failure checking** â€“ parse output files to detect and report failures.
- **Capture both success and failure outputs** for comprehensive debugging.
- **Use consistent naming convention**: `{test_name}_results_{timestamp}.txt`.
- **Include test metadata**: timestamp, test duration, success/failure count, error details.
- **Store outputs in a dedicated directory** (e.g., `test_outputs/` or `logs/`).

### Development Workflow Requirements
- **Document all major decisions** in this file with rationale and context.
- **Record debugging steps** and solutions for future reference.
- **Update project status** after each significant change.
- **Maintain chronological development log** with timestamps.
- **Cross-reference related documentation** and external resources.

ðŸ†• July 2025: Comprehensive Code Quality Improvements and Linter Compliance

- **Achieved 100% linter compliance**: Successfully resolved all flake8 linting errors across the entire codebase, including whitespace issues, import organization, and code style violations.
- **Fixed null byte corruption issues**: Identified and resolved null byte corruption in several `__init__.py` files within the plugins directory that were causing syntax errors and preventing proper module imports.
- **Enhanced plugin system stability**: Cleaned up and standardized all plugin files (`aspect_generator`, `house_generator`, `theme_switcher`, `astrology_chat`) to ensure consistent code quality and proper functionality.
- **Improved testing infrastructure**: Updated test files to follow consistent formatting standards and removed any linting violations that could interfere with test execution.
- **Code cleanup automation**: Created and executed multiple cleanup scripts (`final_cleanup.py`, `surgical_fix.py`, `fix_linter_issues.py`) to systematically address code quality issues across the entire project.
- **Security validation**: Confirmed that all sensitive data remains properly secured in environment variables with no hardcoded secrets or API keys in the codebase.
- **Documentation updates**: Updated README.md and CURSOR_ONBOARDING.md to reflect current project state, including new features, testing procedures, and development guidelines.
- **Outcome**: The codebase is now production-ready with:
  - Zero linter errors or warnings
  - Consistent code formatting across all files
  - Proper module imports and syntax
  - Enhanced plugin system reliability
  - Comprehensive testing coverage
  - Updated documentation reflecting current capabilities

ðŸ†• July 2025: Debugging & Fixes for Master Chart Interpretation and House Cusps

- **Resolved a persistent TypeError** (`unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'float' and 'str'`) that prevented master chart interpretations from rendering. The error was traced to the construction of the `ascendant` and `midheaven` fields in the master prompt data, especially when house cusp calculations failed or returned malformed data.
- **Improved robustness of master prompt data construction**: Now, all values (especially those derived from house cusps and ascendant) are type-checked and safely converted to strings, preventing float+str errors even when house data is missing or invalid.
- **Enhanced logging**: Added detailed logging to capture the types and values of all master prompt data fields, which helped pinpoint the source of the error.
- **Rate limit debugging**: Provided guidance and commands to clear the Django cache and reset the rate limit during development/testing, ensuring smoother local testing workflows.
- **Server management**: Demonstrated how to safely stop, restart, and clear the cache for the Django development server as part of the debugging process.
- **Outcome**: The master chart interpretation now renders correctly, even when house cusp data is missing or invalid, and the system is more robust against malformed ephemeris data.

ðŸ†• July 2025: House Position Calculation System Overhaul & Plugin Integration Fixes

- **Fixed Swiss Ephemeris API usage for house position calculations**: Resolved critical issues with `swe.house_pos` function calls that were causing all planets to display in the 1st house regardless of their actual positions. The correct API signature was identified and implemented: `swe.house_pos(armc, lat, eps, [longitude, latitude], hs_code)` where `hs_code` is a byte string (e.g., `b'P'` for Placidus).
- **Corrected house system mapping**: Updated the house system mapping to use consistent byte string codes (`b'P'` for Placidus, `b'W'` for Whole Sign) across both `swe.houses` and `swe.house_pos` function calls.
- **Fixed plugin data format mismatches**: Resolved critical data format inconsistencies between the main chart generation system and the plugin system. The main system returns `chart_data['planetary_positions']` and `chart_data['house_cusps']`, but plugins were expecting `chart_data['positions']` and `chart_data['houses']`. Updated both `aspect_generator` and `house_generator` plugins to use the correct data keys.
- **Enhanced house position calculation robustness**: Improved error handling and fallback mechanisms for house position calculations, including better validation of house cusps data and manual house calculation when `swe.house_pos` fails.
- **Comprehensive cache clearing system**: Created multiple cache clearing scripts to address different caching layers:
  - `clear_cache.py` - Clears all Django cache
  - `clear_ai_cache.py` - Clears AI interpretation cache specifically
  - `clear_session_cache.py` - Clears Django session cache and session data from database
- **Added debugging infrastructure**: Implemented detailed logging throughout the house position calculation pipeline to track:
  - House cusp calculations and validation
  - Individual planet house position calculations
  - Data format transformations between systems
  - Cache hit/miss patterns
- **Fixed aspect integration**: Ensured that aspect calculations properly integrate with the corrected house position system, allowing aspects to reference accurate house placements in interpretations.
- **Outcome**: Planetary house positions now display correctly across all systems:
  - Master chart interpretations show varied house positions (e.g., Sun in 6th house, Moon in 8th house, etc.)
  - Individual planet interpretations use correct house positions
  - Plugin system (aspect_generator, house_generator) works with accurate house data
  - No more "all planets in 1st house" display issues
- **Testing validation**: Created `test_house_positions.py` script to validate house position calculations independently and ensure the Swiss Ephemeris API integration works correctly.
- **Cross-system compatibility**: Ensured that the fixed house position system works consistently across:
  - Main chart generation views (`chart/views.py`)
  - Plugin system (`plugins/aspect_generator/`, `plugins/house_generator/`)
  - Background task processing (`chart/tasks.py`)
  - API endpoints (`api/v1/views.py`)
