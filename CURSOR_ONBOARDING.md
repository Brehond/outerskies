# Outer Skies: Cursor Pro Onboarding & Team Guide

Welcome to the Outer Skies project! This document is designed for new team members and Cursor Pro chat instances to quickly get up to speed and collaborate effectively.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview
Outer Skies is an astrology web application that combines traditional astrology calculations (using Swiss Ephemeris) with AI-powered interpretations. It uses Django, PostgreSQL, Tailwind CSS, Docker, and integrates with the OpenRouter API for AI features.

**Current Status:** ✅ **Production-Ready Core Infrastructure**

---

## ⚡ Quick Start for Cursor Pro
1. **Clone the repository** and set up your Python virtual environment (see `README.md`).
2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Copy environment variables:**
   ```sh
   cp env.example .env
   # Edit .env as needed
   ```
4. **Run migrations:**
   ```sh
   python manage.py migrate
   ```
5. **Start the development server:**
   ```sh
   python manage.py runserver
   ```
6. **Access the app:**
   - Open [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/) in your browser.

## 🔒 Security Infrastructure (COMPLETED ✅)
The project now has a comprehensive security middleware stack:

### **Active Security Middleware:**
- **EnhancedSecurityMiddleware** - XSS protection, SQL injection prevention
- **RateLimitMiddleware** - Per-IP rate limiting and concurrent request control
- **APIAuthMiddleware** - JWT token validation and API key authentication
- **DataValidationMiddleware** - Request data validation with JSON schemas
- **PasswordSecurityMiddleware** - Password complexity and history enforcement
- **FileUploadSecurityMiddleware** - File type validation and virus scanning
- **ErrorHandlingMiddleware** - Custom error pages and logging
- **SessionSecurityMiddleware** - Session rotation and security
- **APIVersionMiddleware** - API versioning support
- **RequestSigningMiddleware** - HMAC signature validation
- **EncryptionMiddleware** - Request/response encryption

### **Security Features:**
- ✅ File upload security (blocks large files, invalid types)
- ✅ Password security (enforces complexity requirements)
- ✅ Session security (blocks invalid session attempts)
- ✅ Rate limiting (prevents abuse)
- ✅ Request signing (validates signatures)
- ✅ Encryption (handles encrypted requests)
- ✅ API authentication (validates API keys)

### **Testing:**
- ✅ All security features fully tested
- ✅ 9 comprehensive security tests passing
- ✅ No linting errors or whitespace issues
- ✅ Clean codebase with proper formatting

## 🤖 Using Cursor Pro with Outer Skies
- **Ask for code explanations, file summaries, or architecture diagrams.**
- **Request code edits, new features, or bug fixes.**
- **Run and debug tests, migrations, and server commands.**
- **Use the `CURSOR_ONBOARDING.md` as a reference for project context.**
- **Check `README.md` and `TEAM_SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md` for more details.**

---

## 🤝 Development & Collaboration Guidelines
- **Branching:** Use feature branches for new work, merge to `main` via PRs.
- **Commits:** Write clear, descriptive commit messages.
- **Testing:** Add/maintain tests for new features and bug fixes.
- **Plugins:** Follow the `PLUGIN_SYSTEM_GUIDE.md` for plugin development.
- **Security:** Review `SECURITY_AUDIT_REPORT.md` for best practices.
- **Code Quality:** All code passes flake8 linting with no whitespace issues.
