ðŸ”¹ DESCRIPTION
This module generates the Mars placement section of an astrology report using the full Outer Skies Synthesis Core v1.5 format. It weaves together Marsâ€™s sign, house, aspects, dignity, sect, and dispositor to present a dynamic narrative of Marsâ€™s role as the planet of action, drive, courage, and conflict. Emphasis is placed on how Marsâ€™s placement shapes assertion, ambition, sexual energy, and the courage to initiate â€” guiding the individual toward purposeful engagement and self-assertion.

ðŸ”¹ STRUCTURE: Synthesis Paragraphs (P1â€“P10)
------------------------------------------------------------
P1: Anchor Headline
â€¢ Declare Mars sign + house + overarching theme of energy, assertion, or conflict.

P2: Planet in Sign & Planet in House
â€¢ Discuss Marsâ€™s sign-based expression (element/modality, dignity or weakness).
â€¢ Explore how Marsâ€™s presence in the house activates domains of drive, ambition, and assertion.

P3: Integrated Signâ€“House Meaning
â€¢ Blend signâ€™s characteristics with house themes to identify arenas of assertive action or potential tension.

P4: Dignities & Sect
â€¢ Essential dignity (rulership in Aries and Scorpio, exaltation in Capricorn, detriment, fall).
â€¢ Accidental dignity (angularity, speed, retrograde, joy â€” Mars rejoices in the 6th).
â€¢ Sect logic: Mars is in sect in nocturnal charts; out of sect in diurnal charts. In sect, Marsâ€™s energy is disciplined, focused, and assertive. Out of sect, it can become impulsive, erratic, or scattered â€” manifesting as conflicts, friction, or misdirected efforts.

P5: Rulership & Condition
â€¢ Identify Marsâ€™s dispositor (ruler of its sign) with sign, house, and condition.
â€¢ Note dignities, retrograde, reception, sect alignment, and house strength of the dispositor.
â€¢ Discuss how the dispositor shapes Marsâ€™s delivery of energy â€” whether it becomes constructive drive, focused courage, or destructive conflict.
â€¢ Highlight that when Mars resides in Aries or Scorpio (its traditional domiciles), its energetic power is magnified within that houseâ€™s concerns.

P6: Ruled Signs & Houses
â€¢ Identify the two houses in the current chart ruled by Aries and Scorpio (Marsâ€™s natural domains).
â€¢ For each house:
  â€“ Note any planets present (sign, degree, retrograde status, sect).
  â€“ Assess the condition of the house ruler (dignity, reception, angularity).
  â€“ Explore how Martian themes (assertion, transformation, ambition) manifest in that domain.

P7: Aspect Inventory
â€¢ List all aspects to Mars â‰¤ 6Â° orb (conjunction, sextile, square, trine, opposition).
â€¢ For each: aspect type, planet, orb, applying/separating, and effect on Marsâ€™s drive or challenges.

P8: Aspect Integration
â€¢ Integrate aspect patterns into Marsâ€™s assertion profile â€” where ambition is fortified or tensions arise.

P9: Configurations
â€¢ Note geometrical features: conflict patterns, grand crosses, midpoint activations, or Mars return windows.
â€¢ Highlight configurations that spotlight Marsâ€™s role in personal assertion or collective challenge.

P10: Grand Synthesis
â€¢ Weave all preceding layers into a unified life arc of Marsâ€™s dynamic energy journey.
â€¢ Articulate how Mars guides the individual toward courageous action, transformative drive, and balanced assertion across life stages.
â€¢ Close with a grounded, complete sentence.

ðŸ”¹ EXECUTION PIPELINE
------------------------------------------------------------
1. Load Metadata: Ingest hidden inputs (birth data, placement, aspects, etc.)
2. Validate Inputs: Ensure all required metadata fields are present and valid.
3. Initialize Context: Apply chart-wide settings (sect status, house system, rulership mode).
4. Generate P1â€“P10: Sequentially synthesize narrative paragraphs using Marsâ€™s metadata and chart context.
5. Compile Glossary: Populate definitions and rulership/detriment entries.
6. Final Assembly: Merge text sections, glossary, and version status into final document structure.
7. Output: Return populated Mars module ready for integration into report.

ðŸ”¹ GLOSSARY
------------------------------------------------------------
â€¢ Angularity: Strength conferred by planets in angular houses (1st, 4th, 7th, 10th).
â€¢ Aspect: Angular relationship between Mars and another planet (conjunction, sextile, square, trine, opposition).
â€¢ Dispositor: The planetary ruler of Marsâ€™s sign; shapes Marsâ€™s expression through reception and condition.
â€¢ Dignity: Classification of planetary strength by sign (rulership, exaltation, detriment, fall).
â€¢ Exaltation: Sign where Mars excels (Capricorn).
â€¢ Fall: Sign of Marsâ€™s greatest weakness (Cancer).
â€¢ Traditional Rulership: Mars rules Aries and Scorpio.
â€¢ Detriment: Signs opposite Marsâ€™s rulerships (Libra and Taurus).
â€¢ Joy: House where Mars rejoices (6th), signifying disciplined effort and mastery through work.
â€¢ Retrograde: Apparent backward motion, indicating internalized or redirected Martian energy.
â€¢ Sect: Chart division into diurnal or nocturnal; Mars is in sect by night, out of sect by day.
â€¢ Sect Enforcement: Logic that magnifies or softens Marsâ€™s assertion depending on sect alignment.
â€¢ Strength Chain: Series of dignified rulers linking planetary significators.
