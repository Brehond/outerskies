ðŸ”¹ DESCRIPTION
This module generates the Jupiter placement section of an astrology report using the full Outer Skies Synthesis Core v1.5 format. It weaves together Jupiterâ€™s sign, house, aspects, dignity, sect, and dispositor to present a cohesive vision of Jupiterâ€™s role as the great benefic and amplifier of optimism, learning, and abundance. Emphasis is placed on how Jupiterâ€™s placement shapes generosity, belief systems, travel, cultural engagement, and spiritual growth â€” guiding the individual toward their most expansive horizons.

ðŸ”¹ STRUCTURE: Synthesis Paragraphs (P1â€“P10)
------------------------------------------------------------
P1: Anchor Headline
â€¢ Declare Jupiter sign + house + overarching theme of expansion, faith, or opportunity.

P2: Planet in Sign & Planet in House
â€¢ Discuss Jupiterâ€™s sign-based expression (element/modality, dignity or weakness).
â€¢ Explore how Jupiterâ€™s presence in the house brings growth, opportunity, or spiritual outlooks.

P3: Integrated Signâ€“House Meaning
â€¢ Blend signâ€™s characteristics with house themes to identify the domain of greatest potential or philosophical development.

P4: Dignities & Sect
â€¢ Essential dignity (rulership, exaltation in Cancer, detriment, fall).
â€¢ Accidental dignity (angularity, speed, retrograde, joy â€” Jupiter rejoices in the 9th).
â€¢ Sect logic: Jupiter in sect in diurnal charts; out of sect in nocturnal charts. In sect, Jupiterâ€™s benefic influence flows generously â€” optimism, faith, and expansion. Out of sect, it can become excessive â€” overextension, indulgence, or scattered energy.

P5: Rulership & Condition
â€¢ Identify Jupiterâ€™s dispositor (ruler of its sign) with sign, house, and condition.
â€¢ Note dignities, retrograde, reception, sect alignment, and house strength of the dispositor.
â€¢ Discuss how the dispositor shapes Jupiterâ€™s delivery of growth, protection, and belief â€” whether supportive or challenging.
â€¢ Highlight that when Jupiter resides in Sagittarius or Pisces (its traditional domiciles), its benefic power is magnified within that houseâ€™s concerns.

P6: Ruled Signs & Houses
â€¢ Identify the two houses in the current chart ruled by Sagittarius and Pisces (Jupiterâ€™s natural domains).
â€¢ For each house:
  â€“ Note any planets present (sign, degree, retrograde status, sect).
  â€“ Assess the condition of the house ruler (dignity, reception, angularity).
  â€“ Explore how Jupiterian themes (expansion, vision, travel, spiritual connection) manifest within that domain.

P7: Aspect Inventory
â€¢ List all aspects to Jupiter â‰¤ 6Â° orb (conjunction, sextile, square, trine, opposition).
â€¢ For each: aspect type, planet, orb, applying/separating, and effect on Jupiterâ€™s expansion or challenges.

P8: Aspect Integration
â€¢ Integrate aspect patterns into Jupiterâ€™s mode of growth â€” where faith and optimism are strengthened or tested.

P9: Configurations
â€¢ Note geometrical features: overcoming, enclosure, aversion, superior square, or Jupiter return windows.
â€¢ Highlight patterns such as grand trines, T-squares, or midpoint activations that modulate Jupiterâ€™s abundance and opportunities.

P10: Grand Synthesis
â€¢ Weave all preceding layers into a unified life arc of Jupiterâ€™s journey.
â€¢ Articulate how Jupiter guides the individual toward wisdom, spiritual abundance, and expansive growth across life stages.
â€¢ Close with a grounded, complete sentence.

ðŸ”¹ EXECUTION PIPELINE
------------------------------------------------------------
1. Load Metadata: Ingest hidden inputs (birth data, placement, aspects, etc.)
2. Validate Inputs: Ensure all required metadata fields are present and valid.
3. Initialize Context: Apply chart-wide settings (sect status, house system, rulership mode).
4. Generate P1â€“P10: Sequentially synthesize narrative paragraphs using Jupiterâ€™s metadata and chart context.
5. Compile Glossary: Populate definitions and rulership/detriment entries.
6. Final Assembly: Merge text sections, glossary, and version status into final document structure.
7. Output: Return populated Jupiter module ready for integration into report.

ðŸ”¹ GLOSSARY
------------------------------------------------------------
â€¢ Angularity: Strength conferred by planets in angular houses (1st, 4th, 7th, 10th).
â€¢ Aspect: Angular relationship between Jupiter and another planet (conjunction, sextile, square, trine, opposition).
â€¢ Dispositor: The planetary ruler of Jupiterâ€™s sign; shapes Jupiterâ€™s expression through reception and condition.
â€¢ Dignity: Classification of planetary strength by sign (rulership, exaltation, detriment, fall).

â€¢ Traditional Rulership: Jupiter rules Sagittarius and Pisces.
â€¢ Detriment: Signs opposite Jupiterâ€™s rulerships (Gemini and Virgo).
â€¢ Joy: House where Jupiter rejoices (9th), signifying spiritual journeys and expansive thinking.
â€¢ Retrograde: Apparent backward motion, indicating internalized or delayed Jupiterian themes.
â€¢ Sect: Chart division into diurnal or nocturnal; Jupiter in sect by day, out of sect by night.
â€¢ Sect Enforcement: Logic that magnifies or softens Jupiterâ€™s benefic expression depending on sect.
â€¢ Strength Chain: Series of dignified rulers linking planetary significators.
