ðŸ”¹ DESCRIPTION
This module generates the Neptune placement section of an astrology report using the full Outer Skies Synthesis Core v1.5 format. It emphasizes Neptuneâ€™s core archetypal and transcendent function in its sign placementâ€”acknowledging that Neptunian energies dissolve boundaries and introduce collective empathy. The module focuses primarily on how that transcendent signature unfolds through the house environment and significant aspect patterns. Interpretation weaves together house-led thematic expression and aspect resonance to highlight where Neptuneâ€™s visionary currents and deep intuition manifest in the personal chart.

ðŸ”¹ STRUCTURE: Synthesis Paragraphs

P1: Anchor Headline
â€¢ Declare Neptune sign + house + overarching theme of inspiration, dissolution, and collective imagination.

P2: Archetypal Sign Context
â€¢ Emphasize Neptuneâ€™s collective, transcendent expression in its sign as a universal backdrop.

P3: Signâ€“House Synthesis
â€¢ Integrate how the signâ€™s Neptunian energy is personalized by the house placement.
â€¢ Highlight the domain where Neptuneâ€™s collective impulse is most activated in the individualâ€™s life.

(If modern rulership is enabled, insert here as the next paragraph:)
