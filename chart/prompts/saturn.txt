ðŸ”¹ DESCRIPTION
This module generates the Saturn placement section of an astrology report using the full Outer Skies Synthesis Core v1.5 format. It includes sign, house, aspects, dignity, rulership, and sect logic fully embedded within the narrative flow. Special attention is given to Saturn's role as the boundary-maker and tester, reflecting karmic themes, long-term cycles, and maturation processes.

ðŸ”¹ STRUCTURE: Synthesis Paragraphs (P1â€“P10)
------------------------------------------------------------
P1: Anchor Headline
â€¢ Declare Saturn sign + house + dominant life challenge or structural theme

P2: Planet in Sign & Planet in House
â€¢ Discuss Saturnâ€™s expression in the sign (element/modality, dignity/weakness)
â€¢ Describe Saturnâ€™s behavioral tone in the house (delays, discipline, lessons)

P3: Integrated Signâ€“House Meaning
â€¢ Merge Saturnâ€™s sign style with house concerns to form the karmic challenge or area of fortification

P4: Dignities & Sect
â€¢ Essential dignity (rulership, exaltation, detriment, fall)
â€¢ Accidental dignity (angularity, speed, retrograde, joy â€” Saturn rejoices in the 12th)
â€¢ Sect logic: Saturn in sect in diurnal charts; out of sect in nocturnal charts. In sect: Constructive Saturn â€” discipline, wisdom through experience, order, mastery. Out of sect: Harder to integrate â€” can manifest as isolation, burden, harshness, or coldness

P5: Rulership & Condition
â€¢ Identify Saturnâ€™s dispositor (ruler of the sign Saturn is in), with sign, house, and condition
â€¢ Note dignities, retrograde, reception, sect alignment, or house strength of dispositor
â€¢ Discuss how the dispositor affects Saturnâ€™s delivery of structure or inhibition
â€¢ Note domicile house placements: when Saturn resides in its traditional domiciles of Capricorn or Aquarius, its structural potency is magnified within those house themes
â€¢ Highlight that regardless of Saturnâ€™s placement, any house ruled by Capricorn or Aquarius carries Saturnian themes of discipline, boundaries, and societal responsibility

P6: Ruled Signs & Houses
â€¢ Identify the two houses in the current chart ruled by Capricorn (traditional Saturn) and Aquarius (modern Saturn). These may be any of the twelve houses (e.g., 12th & 9th).
â€¢ For each house ruled by Capricorn or Aquarius:
  â€“ Note any planets located in that house and list their sign, degree, retrograde status, and sect.
  â€“ Assess the condition of the house ruler (dignity, reception, angularity).
  â€“ Describe how Saturnian themes manifest through the activities of that house (structure, discipline, boundaries).

P7: Aspect Inventory
â€¢ List all aspects to Saturn â‰¤ 6Â° orb (trine, square, conjunction, etc.)
â€¢ For each: aspect type, planet, orb, applying/separating, and effect on Saturn's restraint/discipline

P8: Aspect Integration
â€¢ Integrate aspect patterns into Saturnâ€™s mode of control, resistance, delay, or spiritual testing

P9: Configurations
â€¢ Note geometrical features: overcoming, enclosure, aversion, superior square, Saturn return windows
â€¢ Optional: placement in angular triads, dignified chains, or peregrine isolation

P10: Grand Synthesis
â€¢ Merge all above layers into a karmic or structural life arc
â€¢ Deliver final insight about Saturnâ€™s developmental role across life stages
â€¢ Close with a grounded, complete sentence

ðŸ”¹ EXECUTION PIPELINE
------------------------------------------------------------
1. Load Metadata: Ingest hidden inputs (birth data, placement, aspects, etc.)
2. Validate Inputs: Ensure all required metadata fields are present and within expected ranges
3. Initialize Context: Set chart conditions (sect, house system, rulership mode)
4. Generate P1â€“P10: Sequentially invoke synthesis logic for each paragraph, passing necessary metadata and intermediate results
5. Compile Glossary: Populate definitions and rulership/detriment entries
6. Final Assembly: Merge text sections, glossary, and version status into final document structure
7. Output: Return populated Saturn module ready for integration into report

ðŸ”¹ GLOSSARY
------------------------------------------------------------
â€¢ Angularity: Placement in angular houses (1st, 4th, 7th, 10th) confers strength and visibility.
â€¢ Aspect: Angular relationship between Saturn and another planet; classical aspects include conjunction, sextile, square, trine, opposition.
â€¢ Dispositor: The planetary ruler of the sign containing Saturn; indicates supportive or challenging influences.
â€¢ Dignity: Classification of planet strength by sign: rulership, exaltation, detriment, fall.
â€¢ Exaltation: Sign where Saturn functions with maximum dignity (Libra).
â€¢ Fall: Sign of Saturnâ€™s greatest weakness (Aries).
â€¢ Traditional Rulership: Saturn rules Capricorn and Aquarius.
â€¢ Modern Rulership: Saturn rules Aquarius.
â€¢ Detriment: Saturn is diminished in Cancer and in Leo.
â€¢ Joy: House where Saturn rejoices (12th house), expressing comfort in solitude and spiritual retreat.
â€¢ Retrograde: Apparent backward motion, indicating internalized or delayed Saturnian themes.
â€¢ Sect: Assignment to diurnal (day) or nocturnal (night) charts; Saturn is in-sect by day, out-of-sect by night.
â€¢ Sect Enforcement: Logic applied based on sect status, intensifying or smoothing Saturnâ€™s challenges.
â€¢ Strength Chain: Series of dignified rulers linking planetary dispositions.
