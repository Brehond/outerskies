ðŸ”¹ DESCRIPTION
This module generates the Uranus placement section of an astrology report using the full Outer Skies Synthesis Core v1.5 format. It emphasizes Uranusâ€™ core generational and unconscious function in its sign placementâ€”acknowledging that Uranian sign reflects a collective, archetypal backdrop. The module focuses primarily on how that generational signature is activated through the house environment and powerful aspect configurations. Interpretation weaves together house-led thematic expression and aspect strength to highlight where Uranian breakthroughs and individual awakenings manifest in the personal chart.

â€¢ Declare Uranus sign + house + overarching theme of collective dynamism and personal awakening.

P2: Generational Sign Context
