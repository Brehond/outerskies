ðŸ”¹ DESCRIPTION
This module generates the Sun placement section of an astrology report using the full Outer Skies Synthesis Core v1.5 format. It includes sign, house, aspects, dignity, rulership, and sect logic fully embedded within the narrative flow. Special attention is given to the Sunâ€™s role as the heart of the chart â€” representing vitality, life purpose, and the central creative drive that seeks to express itself in the world.

ðŸ”¹ STRUCTURE: Synthesis Paragraphs (P1â€“P10)
------------------------------------------------------------
P1: Anchor Headline
â€¢ Declare Sun sign + house + core life theme or creative spark

P2: Planet in Sign & Planet in House
â€¢ Discuss the Sunâ€™s expression in the sign (element/modality, dignity/weakness)
â€¢ Describe the Sunâ€™s behavioral tone in the house (creative pursuits, confidence, visibility)

P3: Integrated Signâ€“House Meaning
â€¢ Merge the Sunâ€™s sign style with house concerns to form the core area of self-expression or identity focus

P4: Dignities & Sect
â€¢ Essential dignity (rulership, exaltation, detriment, fall).
â€¢ Accidental dignity (angularity, speed, condition).
â€¢ Sect logic: Sun in sect in diurnal charts as the **sect light**; out of sect in nocturnal charts. In sect, solar power shines bright â€” confidence, radiance, expression of vitality. Out of sect, it can feel harder to integrate â€” challenges to confidence, self-assertion, or purpose.

P5: Rulership & Condition
â€¢ Identify the Sunâ€™s dispositor (ruler of the Sunâ€™s sign), with sign, house, and condition.
â€¢ Note dignities, reception, sect alignment, or house strength of dispositor.
â€¢ Discuss how the dispositor affects the Sunâ€™s ability to radiate life purpose and authority.
â€¢ Note domicile house placements: when the Sun is in Leo (its domicile), its potency for leadership and creativity is magnified within those house themes.
â€¢ Highlight that any house ruled by Leo carries solar themes of radiance, leadership, and creative identity.

P6: Ruled Signs & Houses
â€¢ Identify the house in the current chart ruled by Leo (traditional Sun domain).
â€¢ Note any planets located in that house, their sign, degree, retrograde status, and sect.
â€¢ Assess the condition of the house ruler (dignity, reception, angularity).
â€¢ Describe how solar themes of radiance and creative expression manifest through the activities of that house.

P7: Aspect Inventory
â€¢ List all aspects to the Sun â‰¤ 6Â° orb (trine, square, conjunction, etc.).
â€¢ For each: aspect type, planet, orb, applying/separating, and effect on the Sunâ€™s ability to radiate purpose and identity.

P8: Aspect Integration
â€¢ Integrate aspect patterns into the Sunâ€™s creative expression, confidence, and sense of authority.

P9: Configurations
â€¢ Note geometrical features: overcoming, enclosure, aversion, superior square, Sun return windows.
â€¢ Optional: placement in angular triads, dignified chains, or isolated placements.

P10: Grand Synthesis
â€¢ Merge all above layers into a central life arc of solar vitality.
â€¢ Deliver final insight about the Sunâ€™s role as the core of identity and creative self-expression across life stages.
â€¢ Close with a grounded, complete sentence.

ðŸ”¹ EXECUTION PIPELINE
------------------------------------------------------------
1. Load Metadata: Ingest hidden inputs (birth data, placement, aspects, etc.).
2. Validate Inputs: Ensure all required metadata fields are present and within expected ranges.
3. Initialize Context: Set chart conditions (sect, house system, rulership mode).
4. Generate P1â€“P10: Sequentially invoke synthesis logic for each paragraph, passing necessary metadata and intermediate results.
5. Compile Glossary: Populate definitions and rulership/detriment entries.
6. Final Assembly: Merge text sections, glossary, and version status into final document structure.
7. Output: Return populated Sun module ready for integration into report.

ðŸ”¹ GLOSSARY
------------------------------------------------------------
â€¢ Angularity: Placement in angular houses (1st, 4th, 7th, 10th) confers strength and visibility.
â€¢ Aspect: Angular relationship between the Sun and another planet; classical aspects include conjunction, sextile, square, trine, opposition.
â€¢ Dispositor: The planetary ruler of the sign containing the Sun; indicates supportive or challenging influences.
â€¢ Dignity: Classification of planetary strength by sign (rulership, exaltation, detriment, fall).
â€¢ Exaltation: Sign where the Sun functions with maximum dignity (Aries).
â€¢ Fall: Sign of the Sunâ€™s greatest weakness (Libra).
â€¢ Traditional Rulership: Sun rules Leo.
â€¢ Detriment: Sun is diminished in Aquarius.
â€¢ Retrograde: N/A for the Sun (never retrograde).
â€¢ Sect: Chart division into diurnal (day) or nocturnal (night) charts. The Sun is the **sect light** in diurnal charts, while the Moon is the sect light in nocturnal charts. Sun is in sect by day, out of sect by night.
â€¢ Sect Enforcement: Logic applied based on sect status, intensifying or smoothing the Sunâ€™s radiance.
â€¢ Strength Chain: Series of dignified rulers linking planetary dispositions.
