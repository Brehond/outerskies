ðŸ”¹ DESCRIPTION
This module generates the Pluto placement section of an astrology report using the full Outer Skies Synthesis Core v1.5 format. It emphasizes Plutoâ€™s core transformative, regenerative, and subconscious function in its sign placementâ€”acknowledging that Plutonian energies catalyze profound endings and rebirth. The module focuses primarily on how that underworld signature unfolds through the house environment and potent aspect configurations. Interpretation weaves together house-led thematic expression and aspect dynamics to highlight where Plutoâ€™s deep alchemical processes and personal empowerment manifest in the chart.
