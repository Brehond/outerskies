ðŸ”¹ DESCRIPTION
This module generates the Mercury placement section of an astrology report using the full Outer Skies Synthesis Core v1.5 format. It weaves together Mercuryâ€™s sign, house, aspects, dignity, sect (with morning/evening star status), and dispositor to reveal Mercuryâ€™s role as the planet of thought, communication, learning, and exchange. Emphasis is placed on how Mercuryâ€™s placement shapes the mindâ€™s style and voice, adaptability, and areas of curiosity or challenge â€” guiding the individual to develop clarity, discernment, and skillful dialogue.

ðŸ”¹ STRUCTURE: Synthesis Paragraphs (P1â€“P10)
------------------------------------------------------------
P1: Anchor Headline
â€¢ Declare Mercury sign + house + overarching theme of communication, learning, or mental style.

P2: Planet in Sign & Planet in House
â€¢ Discuss Mercuryâ€™s sign-based expression (element/modality, dignity or weakness).
â€¢ Explore how Mercuryâ€™s presence in the house activates domains of communication, curiosity, or learning.

P3: Integrated Signâ€“House Meaning
â€¢ Blend signâ€™s characteristics with house themes to identify where the mind seeks clarity or connection.

P4: Dignities & Sect
â€¢ Essential dignity (rulership in Gemini and Virgo, exaltation in Virgo, detriment, fall).
â€¢ Accidental dignity (angularity, speed, retrograde, joy â€” Mercury rejoices in the 1st).
â€¢ Sect logic: Mercuryâ€™s sect alignment is unique â€” it depends on whether Mercury is a morning star (rising before the Sun) or an evening star (setting after the Sun).  
â€¢ If Mercuryâ€™s sect alignment matches the chartâ€™s sect (in sect), Mercuryâ€™s intellect is sharp, communication flows smoothly, and adaptability shines.  
â€¢ If Mercury is out of sect, the mind may feel restless, scattered, or prone to dualities and second-guessing.

P5: Rulership & Condition
â€¢ Identify Mercuryâ€™s dispositor (ruler of its sign) with sign, house, and condition.
â€¢ Note dignities, retrograde, reception, sect alignment, and house strength of the dispositor.
â€¢ Discuss how the dispositor shapes Mercuryâ€™s expression â€” whether the mindâ€™s curiosity is supported by clarity and adaptability or prone to indecision and chatter.
â€¢ Highlight that when Mercury resides in Gemini or Virgo (its traditional domiciles), its mental agility and analytical skill are heightened in that houseâ€™s domain.

P6: Ruled Signs & Houses
â€¢ Identify the two houses in the current chart ruled by Gemini and Virgo (Mercuryâ€™s natural domains).
â€¢ For each house:
  â€“ Note any planets present (sign, degree, retrograde status, sect).
  â€“ Assess the condition of the house ruler (dignity, reception, angularity).
  â€“ Explore how Mercuryâ€™s curiosity and communication style animate those houses.

P7: Aspect Inventory
â€¢ List all aspects to Mercury â‰¤ 6Â° orb (conjunction, sextile, square, trine, opposition).
â€¢ For each: aspect type, planet, orb, applying/separating, and effect on Mercuryâ€™s intellect and communication.

P8: Aspect Integration
â€¢ Integrate aspect patterns into Mercuryâ€™s mental profile â€” where thoughts flow smoothly or face disruptions.

P9: Configurations
â€¢ Note geometrical features: intellectual patterns, learning triads, or Mercury return windows.
â€¢ Highlight configurations that emphasize Mercuryâ€™s adaptability and perceptiveness.

P10: Grand Synthesis
â€¢ Weave all preceding layers into a unified life arc of Mercuryâ€™s intellectual journey.
â€¢ Articulate how Mercury guides the individual toward insightful communication, continuous learning, and skillful adaptability across life stages.
â€¢ Close with a grounded, complete sentence.

ðŸ”¹ EXECUTION PIPELINE
------------------------------------------------------------
1. Load Metadata: Ingest hidden inputs (birth data, placement, aspects, etc.)
2. Validate Inputs: Ensure all required metadata fields are present and valid.
3. Initialize Context: Apply chart-wide settings (sect status, house system, rulership mode).
4. Calculate Mercuryâ€™s morning/evening star status and sect alignment.
5. Generate P1â€“P10: Sequentially synthesize narrative paragraphs using Mercuryâ€™s metadata and chart context.
6. Compile Glossary: Populate definitions and rulership/detriment entries.
7. Final Assembly: Merge text sections, glossary, and version status into final document structure.
8. Output: Return populated Mercury module ready for integration into report.

ðŸ”¹ GLOSSARY
------------------------------------------------------------
â€¢ Angularity: Strength conferred by planets in angular houses (1st, 4th, 7th, 10th).
â€¢ Aspect: Angular relationship between Mercury and another planet (conjunction, sextile, square, trine, opposition).
â€¢ Dispositor: The planetary ruler of Mercuryâ€™s sign; shapes Mercuryâ€™s expression through reception and condition.
â€¢ Dignity: Classification of planetary strength by sign (rulership, exaltation, detriment, fall).
â€¢ Exaltation: Sign where Mercury excels (Virgo).
â€¢ Fall: Sign of Mercuryâ€™s greatest weakness (Pisces).
â€¢ Traditional Rulership: Mercury rules Gemini and Virgo.
â€¢ Detriment: Signs opposite Mercuryâ€™s rulerships (Sagittarius and Pisces).
â€¢ Joy: House where Mercury rejoices (1st), highlighting communication and self-knowledge.
â€¢ Retrograde: Apparent backward motion, indicating internal reflection, restlessness, or revisiting ideas.
â€¢ Sect: Chart division into diurnal or nocturnal; shapes how planetary energies are integrated.
â€¢ Mercury Sect Alignment: Mercuryâ€™s sect alignment depends on whether it is a morning star (oriental, rising before the Sun) or an evening star (occidental, setting after the Sun). Morning star Mercury aligns with diurnal charts; evening star Mercury aligns with nocturnal charts.
â€¢ Sect Enforcement: Logic that clarifies or complicates Mercuryâ€™s mental processes based on alignment.
â€¢ Strength Chain: Series of dignified rulers linking planetary significators.
