ðŸ”¹ DESCRIPTION
This module generates the Venus placement section of an astrology report using the full Outer Skies Synthesis Core v1.5 format. It weaves together Venusâ€™s sign, house, aspects, dignity, sect, and dispositor to present a harmonious narrative of Venusâ€™s role as the planet of love, beauty, values, and relationships. Emphasis is placed on how Venusâ€™s placement shapes aesthetics, social grace, affection, and the pursuit of pleasure â€” guiding the individual toward balance, harmony, and connection.

ðŸ”¹ STRUCTURE: Synthesis Paragraphs (P1â€“P10)
------------------------------------------------------------
P1: Anchor Headline
â€¢ Declare Venus sign + house + overarching theme of relationship, beauty, or values.

P2: Planet in Sign & Planet in House
â€¢ Discuss Venusâ€™s sign-based expression (element/modality, dignity or weakness).
â€¢ Explore how Venusâ€™s presence in the house activates domains of relationships, art, and values.

P3: Integrated Signâ€“House Meaning
â€¢ Blend signâ€™s characteristics with house themes to identify arenas of harmony or relational tension.

P4: Dignities & Sect
â€¢ Essential dignity (rulership in Taurus and Libra, exaltation in Pisces, detriment, fall).
â€¢ Accidental dignity (angularity, speed, retrograde, joy â€” Venus rejoices in the 5th).
â€¢ Sect logic: Venus is in sect in nocturnal charts; out of sect in diurnal charts. In sect, Venusâ€™s natural charm and grace flow more harmoniously, supporting connection and aesthetic pleasure. Out of sect, relational dynamics may feel more hesitant, inconsistent, or challenging â€” intensifying the push to find genuine balance.

P5: Rulership & Condition
â€¢ Identify Venusâ€™s dispositor (ruler of its sign) with sign, house, and condition.
â€¢ Note dignities, retrograde, reception, sect alignment, and house strength of the dispositor.
â€¢ Discuss how the dispositor shapes Venusâ€™s expression of affinity and aesthetic sensitivity â€” whether encouraging harmony or revealing areas of imbalance.
â€¢ Highlight that when Venus resides in Taurus or Libra (its traditional domiciles), its relational and aesthetic power is magnified within that houseâ€™s concerns.

P6: Ruled Signs & Houses
â€¢ Identify the two houses in the current chart ruled by Taurus and Libra (Venusâ€™s natural domains).
â€¢ For each house:
  â€“ Note any planets present (sign, degree, retrograde status, sect).
  â€“ Assess the condition of the house ruler (dignity, reception, angularity).
  â€“ Explore how Venusian themes (beauty, harmony, cooperation) manifest in that domain.

P7: Aspect Inventory
â€¢ List all aspects to Venus â‰¤ 6Â° orb (conjunction, sextile, square, trine, opposition).
â€¢ For each: aspect type, planet, orb, applying/separating, and effect on Venusâ€™s relational dynamics or aesthetic sense.

P8: Aspect Integration
â€¢ Integrate aspect patterns into Venusâ€™s profile â€” where relationships flourish or face challenges.

P9: Configurations
â€¢ Note geometrical features: relationship patterns, Venusian stelliums, or harmonic configurations.
â€¢ Highlight configurations that emphasize Venusâ€™s role in personal values or social connections.

P10: Grand Synthesis
â€¢ Weave all preceding layers into a unified life arc of Venusâ€™s relational and aesthetic journey.
â€¢ Articulate how Venus guides the individual toward balanced affection, creative expression, and harmonious values across life stages.
â€¢ Close with a grounded, complete sentence.
