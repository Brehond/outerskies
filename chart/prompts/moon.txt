ðŸ”¹ DESCRIPTION
This module generates the Moon placement section of an astrology report using the full Outer Skies Synthesis Core v1.5 format. It explores the Moonâ€™s role as the seat of emotional intelligence, memory, and instinctive responses, weaving together sign, house, aspect, dignity, and sect logic. Special emphasis is placed on the Moonâ€™s connection to cycles, habit patterns, and nurturing instincts, helping the individual navigate their emotional landscape with awareness and sensitivity.

ðŸ”¹ STRUCTURE: Synthesis Paragraphs (P1â€“P10)
------------------------------------------------------------
P1: Anchor Headline
â€¢ Declare Moon sign + house + central emotional theme or instinctive focus.

P2: Planet in Sign & Planet in House
â€¢ Discuss Moonâ€™s sign-based expression (element, modality, dignity or weakness).
â€¢ Explore how the Moonâ€™s placement in the house shapes emotional needs and habitual responses.

P3: Integrated Signâ€“House Meaning
â€¢ Merge the Moonâ€™s sign style with house concerns to highlight the emotional core of life experience.

P4: Dignities & Sect
â€¢ Essential dignity (rulership, exaltation in Taurus, detriment, fall).
â€¢ Accidental dignity (angularity, speed, waxing/waning phase, joy â€” Moon rejoices in the 3rd house).
â€¢ Sect logic: Moon in sect in nocturnal charts as the **sect light**; out of sect in diurnal charts. In sect, emotional rhythms flow naturally â€” comfort, intuition, instinct. Out of sect, emotional life may feel more exposed or reactive â€” challenges to ease, comfort, or integration.

P5: Rulership & Condition
â€¢ Identify Moonâ€™s dispositor (ruler of the Moonâ€™s sign) with sign, house, and condition.
â€¢ Note dignities, retrograde, reception, sect alignment, and house strength of the dispositor.
â€¢ Discuss how the dispositor influences the Moonâ€™s emotional stability, mood cycles, and nurturing style.
â€¢ Emphasize that when the Moon resides in Cancer (its domicile), its protective and instinctual powers are magnified.

P6: Ruled Signs & Houses
â€¢ Identify the house ruled by Cancer (Moonâ€™s natural domain).
â€¢ For that house:
  â€“ Note any planets present (sign, degree, retrograde status, sect).
  â€“ Assess the condition of the house ruler (dignity, reception, angularity).
  â€“ Describe how lunar themes of safety, comfort, and memory express themselves in that domain.

P7: Aspect Inventory
â€¢ List all aspects to the Moon â‰¤ 6Â° orb (conjunction, sextile, square, trine, opposition).
â€¢ For each: aspect type, planet, orb, applying/separating, and how it modulates the Moonâ€™s moods and reactions.

P8: Aspect Integration
â€¢ Integrate aspect patterns into the Moonâ€™s flow of feelings â€” where emotional support or challenge is found.

P9: Configurations
â€¢ Note geometrical features: overcoming, enclosure, aversion, superior square, lunar return windows.
â€¢ Mention relevant lunation cycles or eclipses that may activate the Moonâ€™s placement.

P10: Grand Synthesis
â€¢ Weave all layers together to chart the emotional journey and instinctive patterns.
â€¢ Offer a final, grounded insight on how the Moon shapes the nativeâ€™s inner world and responsiveness to lifeâ€™s cycles.
â€¢ Close with a grounded, complete sentence.

ðŸ”¹ EXECUTION PIPELINE
------------------------------------------------------------
1. Load Metadata: Ingest hidden inputs (birth data, placement, aspects, etc.)
2. Validate Inputs: Ensure all required metadata fields are present and valid.
3. Initialize Context: Apply chart-wide settings (sect status, house system, rulership mode).
4. Generate P1â€“P10: Sequentially synthesize narrative paragraphs using Moonâ€™s metadata and chart context.
5. Compile Glossary: Populate definitions and rulership/detriment entries.
6. Final Assembly: Merge text sections, glossary, and version status into final document structure.
7. Output: Return populated Moon module ready for integration into report.

ðŸ”¹ GLOSSARY
------------------------------------------------------------
â€¢ Angularity: Strength conferred by planets in angular houses (1st, 4th, 7th, 10th).
â€¢ Aspect: Angular relationship between the Moon and another planet (conjunction, sextile, square, trine, opposition).
â€¢ Dispositor: The planetary ruler of the Moonâ€™s sign; shapes the Moonâ€™s mood and instinctive patterns.
â€¢ Dignity: Classification of planetary strength by sign (rulership, exaltation, detriment, fall).
â€¢ Exaltation: Sign where the Moon excels (Taurus).
â€¢ Fall: Sign of the Moonâ€™s greatest weakness (Scorpio).
â€¢ Traditional Rulership: Moon rules Cancer.
â€¢ Detriment: Sign opposite the Moonâ€™s rulership (Capricorn).
â€¢ Joy: House where the Moon rejoices (3rd), signifying memory and close connections.
â€¢ Sect: Chart division into diurnal (day) or nocturnal (night) charts. The Moon is the **sect light** in nocturnal charts, while the Sun is the sect light in diurnal charts. Moon is in sect by night, out of sect by day.
â€¢ Sect Enforcement: Logic that softens or intensifies the Moonâ€™s emotional themes based on sect.
â€¢ Strength Chain: Series of dignified rulers linking planetary significators.
